<h2>Lab Report Samples</h2>

<p>
  Below are examples of sections from various labs. They are to be
  used as a reference for writing your own thorough lab reports. I
  have tried to keep these as short as possible. Some of these are
  from actual lab reports turned in by students; some are of my own
  writing.

<blockquote>
  We experimentally measured the charge of an electron using
  electrolysis of copper. This value is related to Faraday's constant,
  which provides the charge per mole of electrons. A cell was
  constructed with the same half-reaction (\(Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^-
  \rightarrow Cu_{(s)}\)) occuring in opposite directions. By
  measuring current and the duration of electrolysis we were able to
  calculate the total charge transferred (\(Q\)). We determined the
  total number of electrons stoichiometrically by massing the copper
  electrodes before and after. These data were then combined to find
  the average charge of an electron (\(e\)): $$ e = \frac{Q}{N_e} =
  \frac{It}{2n_{Cu}N_a} $$
