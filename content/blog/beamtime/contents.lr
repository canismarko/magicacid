      My PhD research project involves using X-rays to probe the
      chemistry of lithium-ion battery electrodes. In order to see
      something with a high level of detail, you need to look at it in
      bright light. Analogously, I need access to very high quality
      X-rays. The last two weekends <b>I traveled to two different
      synchrotron</b>; particle accelerators whose sole purpose is to
      generate high intensity X-rays. Each one has 10-30 X-ray beams
      coming off of it, set up to run a variety of experiments. At
      Argonne National Lab's <em>Advanced Photon Source</em> (APS),
      we used diffraction to measure the strain withing a micrometer
      sized particle. At the <em>Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
      Lightsource</em> (SSRL) we collected the data to make
      <strong>three-dimensional reconstructions</strong> of the
      micro-structure of some samples using <strong>X-ray Transmission
      Tomography</strong>.

<h2>The Physics</h2>

    <p>
      Viewed from above, the synchrotron is a big ring. In the case of
      Argonne, it's 1.1km (3,622ft) around. Stanford's is a little
      smaller. Electrons travel around the ring at over 99.99% of the
      speed of light. Anytime a charged particle accelerates, it gives
      off electromagnetic light waves. [NB: "Light" doesn't
      necessarily mean visible light, it can also refer to microwaves,
      UV light, X-rays, etc.] From a physicists perspective, moving in
      a circle is a form of acceleration, so as these electrons travel
      around the ring they give off electromagnetic
      radiation. Because of how fast they're going, the light given
      off is in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The
      electrons also go through special magnets, either "undulators"
      and "wigglers", that give off even better light. These X-rays
      are very bright, quite straight and highly coherent; perfect for
      my research.

      In my research group, we look at cathode materials for
      lithium-ion batteries. These materials are usually crystalline,
      meaning the atoms form a regular, repeating pattern. X-rays are
      really good at probing crystal structures and so with the right
      experiment, we can get a lot of information about our
      sample. The experiment at SSRL made use of an X-ray
      microscope. The concept is analogous to a conventional
      microscope except that X-rays have a much smaller wavelength so
      we can, in theory, resolve much smaller distances. Also,
      different elements absorb X-rays at different wavelengths, so by
      tuning the beam we can actually collect images of just certain
      elements, something conventional microscopy cannot do. We looked
      at the secondary particles of a battery matherial. Then we
      rotated the sample and by taking multiple images were able to
      reconstruct a 3-dimensional model of where specific elements are
      located.

<h2>The Experience</h2>

<p>
  The first reaction to being at a synchrotron was awe. These machines
  are enormous and incredibly complex. At first, the equipment can be
  overwhelming. Fairly quickly, though, I came to realize that each
  piece is straightforward. I certainly don't claim to understand what
  all (or even most) of the pieces do, but there's nothing mysterious
  about their operation. There's also a fair amount of downtime, since
  it takes time to collect all the data and much of the process is
  automated. This provides a good opportunity to wander around
  experiment hall and read the various research posters that the
  different beamlines have created. Each beamline is set up for a
  different technique, so seeing what each is capable of was a
  fascinating tour.
