One thing has become clear to me over the past year: **our political
system in the US needs more scientifically literate people**. Luckily,
the [314 Action](http://www.314action.org/home/) group is working
diligently on this. Last week, they hosted a training event in Chicago
to give scientists the tools to successfully run for political
office. As it turns out, the things that make you a good scientists
also make for great policy, but the process of running a political
campaign is uncomfortable and foregin.

I had a chance to meet two **exciting candidates in the greater
Chicago area**. [Laura Ellman](http://ellmanforillinois.com/) is
running for **state senate** in the Naperville area, and [Marianne
Lalonde](http://marianneforuptown.com/) for the next **Alderman**
(Alderwoman?) in the 46th ward uptown. **Please consider donating**
$50 (or whatever you can) to their campaigns, so we can bring some
much needed science to our local and state government.
