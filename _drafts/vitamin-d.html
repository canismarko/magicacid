  As per my doctor's suggestion, I'm spending the next week on a
  sailboat. No, it's not a blood pressure thing. I had a physical a
  while back and for the most part everything was normal. The one
  exception was <strong>I had low vitamin D</strong>. The
  solution? <strong>Spend more time in the sun</strong>.

  <em>Vitamin D</em> is actually a group of five vitamins:
  D<sub>1</sub> through D<sub>5</sub>. The most important to human
  health are vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> and are usually
  what people mean when they refer to &ldquo;vitamin D&rdquo;. My
  results listed &ldquo;Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy&rdquo; as 18
  \(\frac{ng}{mL}\) and the target range was 30-96
  \(\frac{ng}{mL}\). <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/2/491S/T4.expansion.html"
  title="Table of 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels"> An article</a>
  in <em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> suggests that
  levels below 20 \(\frac{ng}{mL}\) indicates a deficiency. Clearly I need to get those levels up. But why?
</p>

<h2>The Importance of Vitamin D<sub>3</sub></h2>
<p>
  Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> has no significant activity on its own. It's
  just the starting material for a system that regulates the amount of
  calcium your body absorbs. The first step prepares the vitamin for
  use in regulation. Chemists often number the carbons in medium-sized
  organic molecules. The one we're interested in here is carbon
  25. Initally this carbon is bonded to three other carbons and a
  hydrogen atom. In the liver, the hydrogen atom is replaced with an
  oxygen and a hydrogen, a &ldquo;hydroxy group&rdquo;, to
  form <em>25-hydoxy D<sub>3</sub></em>. This process happens readily
  and this molecule is the dominant form of vitamin
  D<sub>3</sub>. This is why my lab work lists the concentration of
  vitamin D in this form.
<p>
<p>
  The second step turns it into the active form. In your kidneys there
  is an enzyme that adds another hydroxy group, this time to the other
  end of the molecule at the 1 position, to form <em>dihydroxy vitamin
  D<sub>3</sub></em>. Once its in the dihydroxy form it can attach to
  a receptor on a protein in the nucleus of cells, called
  the <strong><em>vitamin D recepotor</em></strong>. In intestinal
  cells, activating the <em>vitamin D receptor</em> causes other
  proteins to transport calcium ions across from the intestine to the
  blood. In some other cells, it activates molecules that absorb
  calcium from the blood and build it on to the bones.
</p>
<p>
  The second hydroxylation step is closely regulated by your body. The
  more <em>dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub></em> there is in your
  blood, the less active the kidney enzyme is. The same is true for
  calcium levels. There's also a hormone that also causes more enzyme
  to be produced. In order for these regulatory steps to be effective,
  there needs to be enough of the <em>25-hydroxy vitamin
  D<sub>3</sub></em> molecule. One way to increase this is to have
  more in your diet, for example from <em>Vitamin D milk</em>. The
  other way is to get more sun.
