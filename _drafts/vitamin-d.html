      As per my doctor's suggestion, I'm spending the next week on a
      sailboat. No, it's not a blood pressure thing. I had a physical a
      while back and for the most part everything was normal. The one
      exception was <strong>vitamin D deficiency</strong>. The
      solution? <strong>Spend more time in the sun</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Vitamin D</em> is actually a group of five vitamins:
      D<sub>1</sub> through D<sub>5</sub>. The most relevant to human
      health are vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> and are
      usually what people mean when they refer to &ldquo;vitamin
      D&rdquo;. My results listed &ldquo;Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy&rdquo;
      as 18 \(\frac{ng}{mL}\) and the target range was 30-96
      \(\frac{ng}{mL}\).
      <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/2/491S/T4.expansion.html"
	 title="Table of 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels"> An article</a>
	 in <em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>
	 suggests that levels below 20 \(\frac{ng}{mL}\) indicates a
	 deficiency. Clearly I need to get those levels up. But why?

<h2>The Importance of Vitamin D<sub>3</sub></h2>
<p>
  Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> has no significant activity on its own. It's
  just the starting material for a system that regulates the amount of
  calcium your body absorbs. The first step prepares the vitamin for
  use in regulation. Chemists often number the carbons in medium-sized
  organic molecules. The one we're interested in here is carbon
  25. Initally this carbon is bonded to three other carbons and a
  hydrogen atom. In the liver, the hydrogen atom is replaced with an
  oxygen and a hydrogen, a &ldquo;hydroxy group&rdquo;, to
  form <em>25-hydoxy D<sub>3</sub></em>. This process happens readily
  and this molecule is the dominant form of vitamin
  D<sub>3</sub>. This is why my lab work lists the concentration of
  vitamin D in this form.
<p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
      The second step turns it into the active form. In your kidneys
      there is an enzyme that adds another hydroxy group, this time to
      the other end of the molecule at the 1 position, to
      form <em>dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub></em>. Once its in the
      dihydroxy form it can attach to a receptor on a protein in the
      nucleus of cells, called the <strong><em>vitamin D
      recepotor</em></strong>. Each hydroxy group has a polarity that
      matches up with an amino acid in the <em>vitamin D
      receptor</em>. The common 25-hydroxy form is missing a hydroxy
      group so can't fit nearly as well. In intestinal cells,
      activating the <em>vitamin D receptor</em> causes other proteins
      to transport calcium ions across from the intestine to the
      blood. In bone-sythesizing cells (osteoblasts), it activates
      molecules that absorb calcium from the blood and build it on to
      the bone's organic structure.

      noncovalent bonds between hydroxy groups (red) and the protein.

<p>
  The second hydroxylation step is closely regulated by your body. The
  more <em>dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub></em> there is in your
  blood, the less active the kidney enzyme is. The same is true for
  calcium levels. There's also a hormone that also causes more enzyme
  to be produced. In order for these regulatory steps to be effective,
  there needs to be enough of the <em>25-hydroxy vitamin
  D<sub>3</sub></em> molecule. One way to increase this is to have
  more in your diet, for example from <em>Vitamin D milk</em>. The
  other way is to get more sun.

<h2>Making Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> From Sunlight</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <img src="/images/posts/vitamin-D-synthesis.png" />
    <p class="caption">
      The reaction mechanism for making <em>vitamin D<sub>3</sub></em>
      (right) from <em>7-dehydrocholesterol</em> (left). Ultraviolet
      light breaks one bond to form the intermediate (middle), which
      then rearranges to form the final product.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
      <em>Vitamin D<sub>3</sub></em> is produced in the skin when
      exposed the ultraviolet light, like that from the sun;
      specifically light from 270 &ndash; 290
      nm. <em>7-dehydrocholesterol</em> is present throughout the body
      since it's a precursor to <em>cholesterol</em>, which is a part
      of animal cell membranes. The structures
      of <em>7-dehydrocholesterol</em> and <em>vitamin
      D<sub>3</sub></em> are very similar; the former just has one
      extra ring. When UV light of the right wavelength (270 &ndash;
      300 nm) hits that ring, it breaks one of the bonds. The
      resulting molecule then roatates around the remaining bonds to
      form the more stable corformation that matches <em>vitamin
      D<sub>3</sub></em>. The first step takes place immediately,
      while the second one happens over several days.

  So how much sunlight does it take? The recommended daily allowance
  of <em>vitamin D</em> taken orally is 600 international units
  (IUs). The amount of sun needed to reach this level is influenced by
  a lot of factors: latitude, season, skin color, clothing, sunscreen,
  etc. Generally, though, the <strong>length of time is measured in
  minutes</strong>.
  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962209009487"
     title="Link to source article">One article</a> estimated that
     &ldquo;In Boston, MA, from April to October at 12 PM EST an
     individual with type III skin, with 25.5% of the body surface
     area exposed, would need to spend 3 to 8 minutes in the sun to
     synthesize 400 IU of vitamin D.&rdquo; This is not a question of
     sunbathing to get vitamin D, but more a <strong>question of
     trying to spend a few minutes outside every day</strong>. Also,
     the impact the sun can have on your skin can be negative,
     such as sunburn and increased risk of skin cancer.
</p>

<p>
  As with most fat-soluble vitamins, it is possible to overdose. Too
  much sun doesn't cause problems where vitamin D is concerned,
  though. Once your skin reaches a certain amount of that intermediate
  pre-vitamin, the product starts to break down into other, inactive
  molecules. Cases of vitamin D toxicity are almost always associated
  with people taking too many vitamin D supplements.
</p>

<h2>What About the Other Vitamin D's?</h2>

<p>
  Up until now, I've focused on <em>vitamin D<sub>3</sub></em>. This
  is the one most common in higher animals and the one we also
  synthesize using sunlight. The other varieties are very similar in
  structure, with a few double bonds or methyl groups added on. They
  are generally metabolized by similar processes to <em>vitamin
  D<sub>3</sub></em>. Due to the different shape, they may not have
  the same affinity for the <em>vitamin D receptor</em>. <em>Vitamin
  D<sub>2</sub></em> is the only other common form and is made by a
  variety of fungi. Research suggests it has about 25% of the efficacy
  of <em>vitamin D<sub>3</sub></em>.
