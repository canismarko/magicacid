      One thing has become clear to me over the past year: <strong>our
	political system in the US needs more scientifically literate
	people</strong>. Luckily,
	the <a href="http://www.314action.org/home/">314 Action</a>
	group is working diligently on this. Last week, they hosted a
	training event in Chicago to give scientists the tools to
	successfully run for political office. As it turns out, many
	great scientists find the process of running a political
	campaign uncomfortable and foregin. I'll admit, the idea of
	asking people for money to fund a campagin
	sounds...unpleasant.

      There were two national candidates there, but more exciting were
      the enthustic candidates for local and state offices: less
      glamorous but equally important. There was also a strong
      presence from graduate students and other early-career
      scientists. Completing a PhD and running for office is too much,
      but after grad-school...who knows!

I also had a chance to meet two **exciting candidates in the greater
Chicago area**. [Laura Ellman](http://ellmanforillinois.com/) is
running for **state senate** in the Naperville area, and [Marianne
Lalonde](http://marianneforuptown.com/) for the next **Alderman**
(Alderwoman?) in the 46th ward uptown. **Please consider donating**
$50 (or whatever you can) to their campaigns, so we can **bring some
much needed science** to our local and state government.
