I had the following e-mail exchange with one of my Chem 114 students,
Kinza. Usually, the questions I get are specific to what we're
studying in class and they tend to be easier to answer during office
hours. These questions, on the other hand, were Kinza trying to
understand the concept of entropy. We had covered it *briefly* earlier
in the semester in the chaprter on thermodynamics. It's definitely a
difficult concept, one I don't understand fully myself. It's more in
the physics realm than chemistry but I still felt it was worth
sharing. Published with student's permission.

    Hi Mark,
  </p>
  <p>
    If every reaction that occurs increases the entropy of the
    universe, doesn't that mean that all the reactions going on in the
    universe are causing the entropy of the universe to keep going up?
    What's going to happen to the universe as predicted by
    thermochemistry?

Hi, Kinza.

What a fantastic question! You're absolutely right. There's even an
ominous name for this concept: the [heat death of the
universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe). Basically the universe will be one uniform temperature and
no energy will be left to do useful work.

It's not entirely clear what effect gravity has on entropy so that does make it a little more complicated.

The book *Fabric of the Cosmos* by Brian Greene is worth checking out if you're still curious. It's written as a non-fiction pleasure-reading book. It describes some of the weirder parts of physics but without all the math that's normally involved (for people who may not yet have taken calculus 4). Part II deals a lot with entropy.

Cheers,
Mark

  Hello,
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you!! I've been thinking about it a lot; yes I'm still
    curious! So since the world is reaching an ever-rising level of
    entropy, doesn't that mean everything will eventually become gas
    since gas has the highest entropy?
  </p>
  <p>
    So we don't know whether or not the pull of the universe expanding
    will eventually become stronger than internal forces like gravity?
    Also, is the solar system going to drift apart or do we not know
    what effect entropy has on the solar system yet either?
   </p>

    Sorry, I have so many questions and it's a lot more helpful to ask
    someone who understands this stuff instead of reading articles
    written in words I can't pronounce. Studying the stuff we learned
    in chemistry all semester, looking at it now, I can see that it's
    brushing the surface of something really huge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for telling me about the book! I found the PDF of it
    online I'm going to see what it's all about when finals are over.

Hi, Kinza.

More great questions. I've put my answers down below. These
conversations might make a good blog post. Do you mind if I post them?
If not, would you prefer I include your name or leave it off?

Cheers,
Mark

That's one possibility. Gas has the highest entropy compared to solids
and liquids but it gets tough to compare when you're talking about
exotic things, like blackholes. Gravity has some relationship with
entropy that I don't completely understand.

The ultimate fate of the universe is still unknown. When Einstein came
up with relativity theory, he assumed a static, unchanging universe that
would not have a beginning or end. In the 1920s and 30s, Edwin Hubble
and Georges Lema√Ætre discovered that the universe is actually expanding.
The effects of gravity work to slow down this expansion. If the initial
expansion were fast enough, gravity would not be able to keep up and the
universe would keep expanding forever (heat death). The other option is
that gravity would win and the universe would contract into a
singularity (the "big crunch" model). Started in 1998, evidence was
found that suggested the acceleration of the universe was actually
expanding. This requirs some sort of energy that is always repulsive
(the opposite of gravity) and could push matter faster and faster. We
currently don't what that stuff is; we call it "dark energy", which is
really just a placeholder until we understand it better.

No problem at all. Questions from someone who's genuinely curious are
always fun to answer; a welcome change from the "how do I do this
homework" type questions I usually get. =P

Enjoy. It's one of my favorites. I first read it while I was on vacation
with a friend. I would periodically look up and say things like "Wow!
Did you know that from a physics perspective it's statistically more
likely that all your memories are made up than that they actually
happened" and they would all look at me like I was insane.
