So I've decided to start a blog. I think I'll make it about
**chemistry**. You know, explaining everyday phenomena in a way that's
both informative and easy to understand. Who knows if I'll
succeed. I'm also planning to throw some stuff in about **going to
grad school** and **computer programming**.
