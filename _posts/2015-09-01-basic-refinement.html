  This document will guide the user through a basic whole-pattern
  decomposition of a single phase using the Pawley method. This method
  is simpler than the Rietveld method and will provide a closer fit,
  however the the refined parameters are not physically meaningful so
  the amount of information obtained is limited.
</p>

<p>
  In this tutorial, I will refine a corundum scan taken on our Bruker
  D8 Discover ("Alice"). The diffractogram can be downloaded
  in
  <a href="/supporting-files/corundum.xye" title="Download corundum xye file">
    .xye format</a>. You may also want to look at
    the <a href="/supporting-files/basic-refinement.gpx">finished
    GSAS-II project</a>.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
  Visit
  the <a href="https://subversion.xor.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS">GSAS-II
  website</a> and follow the installation instructions for your
  platform (GNU/Linux, Windows, MacOS). Arch Linux users can install
  <span class="value">gsas2-svn</span> from
  the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gsas2-svn/">arch
  user repository</a>. Upon running GSAS-II for the first time, you
  should see a terminal window and several empty windows, similar to
  the screen shot below.
</p>

<p>
  The terminal window is not normally used, though it can provide
  useful information if your refinement is not succeeding. The other
  two windows are the <span class="heading">plotting
  window</span> and the <span class="heading">data tree</span>
  window. They are currently empty since we have not yet imported any data.
</p>

<h2>Load Powder Data</h2>

<p>
  First we must load a powder data file to refine against. First,
  export your data from Eva as a <span class="value">.xye</span>
  file. In the data tree window, select <span class="menu">Import →
  Powder Data → guess format from file</span>. The first dialog to
  appear will ask you to choose the file containing the powder
  diffraction data. The second dialog asks for an instrument parameter
  file. If you do not have an instrument file, click Cancel and you
  are prompted to choose a generic instrument (eg. CuKα). You should
  now see your data listed in the data tree window.
</p>

<h2>Create Phase Object(s)</h2>

<p>
  The next step is to create a phase object that can be refined
  against the powder data. There are two options for this: importing a
  <span class="value">.cif</span> file or creating a blank
  phase. Once the phase has been created you should see an entry for
  it in the data tree window (you may have to expand the Phases entry.
</p>

<h3>Importing a Phase from a .cif File</h3>

<p>
  If a .cif file is available for your material, this is the easier
  option. The materials project may have one you can download for your
  material. To import a .cif file, in the data tree window select the
  menu <span class="menu">Import → Phase → from CIF file</span>. You
  will be asked to associate this phase with one of more previously
  imported data ("histogram"); you can select your powder data, or
  wait to do so in the next section.
</p>

<h3>Creating a Blank Phase</h3>

<p>
  In the data tree window, select the menu Data → Add phase, you will
  be prompted to name the phase.
</p>

<h3>Prepare for First Refinement</h3>

<p>
  Before running the first refinement cycle, it's necessary to set
  some initial values. If you imported
  a <span class="value">.cif</span> file, some of these may already be
  set for you. This section assumes you have created a blank phase.
</p>

<p>
  In the data-tree window select your phase from the Phases list. A
  new data display window should appear. Select the Data tab. Enter
  your space group in appropriate text box. GSAS-II requires
  spacegroup terms to be separated by a space. The corundum spacegroup
  (R-3c) is entered as "R -3 c". Press enter and confirm your
  choice. You will now notice that your choices for unit-cell
  parameters are restricted to <span class="heading">a</span>
  and <span class="heading">c</span> due to the crystal system
  associated with this spacegroup. Enter approximate unit-cell
  parameters in the appropriate textboxes. Wikipedia lists a=4.75Å and
  c=12.982Å for corundum so let's start there.  Farther down you will
  find a section labeled <span class="heading">Pawley
  controls</span>. Check the checkbox labeled <span class="heading">Do
  Pawley Refinement</span>.
</p>

<p>
  Next switch to the <span class="tab">Data</span> tab. If you see a message reading
  ``This phase has no associated data'', you will first need to create
  a histogram by selecting the menu Edit → Add powder histograms. In
  the new dialog, select your powder data and click okay (skip this
  step if you associated your data when importing a .cif file). Leave
  the values in this tab at their defaults for now; we will come back
  to them later.
</p>

<p>
  We will now move to the <span class="tab">Pawley Reflections</span> tab. Select the
    <span class="menu">Operations → Pawley create</span> menu entry to
  automatically create a list of reflections
  and <span class="menu">Operations → Pawley estimate</span> to have
  GSAS set initial reflection intensities. The
    <span class="heading">refine</span> column contains check boxes
  that indicate which reflection intensities will be refined. Click on
  the column heading to select them all and type "y" to check them.
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, go back to the data-tree and under your powder data entry,
  select the <span class="heading">Sample parameters</span> entry. In the data-display
  dialog, uncheck the <span class="heading">Histogram scale factor</span> box. If
  checked, GSAS will refine the intensities of the reflections as a
  whole, which is unnecessary since we are already refining them
  individually.
</p>

<h2>Evaluating Initial Fit</h2>

<p>
  You are now ready to run the initial refinement. In the data-tree
  window, select the menu <span class="menu">Calculate → Refine</span> (you will be
  prompted to save if you have not done so yet). Assuming the
  refinement runs smoothly, you should be presented with a dialog
  asking you to <span class="heading">Load new result?</span> (click
  <span class="heading">Yes</span>). Click on the powder data entry in
  the data-tree and inspect the results in the plotting window. You
  may have to select the <span class="tab">Powder Patterns</span>
  tab. You should see several overlayed plots showing the original
  diffractogram, the calculated diffractogram, the background fit and
  the difference between the observed and calculated diffractograms.

    <p>
      Chances are, your refinement is not very good at this point, but
      maybe it's good enough. Use the zoom button along the bottom to
      view several peaks close up. Along the center of the plot you
      will see small vertical lines representing the predicted
      reflections. Hopefully, your unit cell parameters are at least
      close enough that the predicted reflections fall somewhere
      within <em>most</em> of the peaks. If not, you may have to
      manually adjust the cell parameters until you're close.
      Something like the figure at the right should work. Select your
      phase and go to the <span class="tab">General</span> tab,
      check <span class="heading">Refine unit cell</span>. Also, for
      your powder data, open the <span class="heading">Sample
      Parameters</span> dialog. Change the diffractometer type
      to <span class="value">Bragg-Brentano</span> and enable
      refinement of <span class="heading">Sample
      displacement</span>. This will help correct any errors due to
      the sample not being mounted at the exact instrument center. Now
      run the refinement again. You may have to re-select your powder
      data in the data-tree to refresh the plot.

<h2>Refining Background</h2>

<p>
  Zoom out on the plot by clicking the home button and look at how
  well the refinement is accounting for the background. It
  may be helpful to zoom vertically to get a better look. In the
  data-tree select the <span class="heading">Background</span> dialog. The default is
  to refine three coefficients, change this to something higher if you
  feel the background is not fit well. For corundum I chose
  10. Re-run the refinement, if you're happy with how the background
  looks, you can move on.
</p>

<h2>Refining Peak Width and Shape</h2>
<p>
  There are two sources of line broadening in diffraction data:
  instrument effects and sample effects. Instrument effects are not
  usually of scientific interest and are lumped together and described
  by parameters in the <span class="heading">Instrument Parameters</span> section. If you
  used an accurate instrument parameters file, these should not need
  much adjusting.
</p>

<p>
  Of more interest are the sample effects. These can be found in the
  dialog for each phase, under the <span class="tab">Data</span>
  tab. They do not have directly refineable parameters, instead you
  must choose a model to describe the peak shapes and widths. Since we
  are doing profile fitting, <strong>the parameters in this tab do not
  reflect their real world analogs</strong>; for that a thorough
  Rietveld treatment is necessary. Select whichever model you prefer
  and check the corresponding box. For corundum, I used
  <span class="heading">size</span>. Sample parameters are usually
  described well by Lorentzian functions, but the Lorentzian/Gaussian
  ratio can be refined by the
  corresponding <span class="heading">LGMix</span> parameter. 1 is
  entirely Lorentzian.

    <p>
      From here, continue going until you achieve the desired
      fit. Each time you run the Refine command, GSAS-II performs
      three refinement cycles. Just because the process ends does not
      mean that it has found the best fit. You may need to run
      the <span class="heading">Refine</span> command several times,
      until the calculated patterns are constant from one refinement
      to the next. For the corundum example, I ended with a cell
      parameters of 4.75903Å and 12.99294Å.
