<p>
  This post is meant as a resource for helping to decide how best to
  send images for posting on websites. There are usually three
  possible options: <strong>lossly bitmaps</strong>, <strong>lossless
  bitmaps</strong> and <strong>vector graphics</strong>. The right
  decision is usually a compromise between a high-quality image that
  gives a clean, sharp presentation to the user, and a small file-size
  so a user doesn't get bored while waiting for your website to load
  all of the 2MB images. Using the right image formats will result in
  a website that loads quickly and has a consistent, sharp layout.

<h2 id="vector">Raster vs Vector Graphics</h2>

<div class="row">

      Image formats basically store information as a series of 1's and
      0's on a computer's hard-drive. Two mains schemes are
      available. <em>Raster graphics</em>, also known
      as <em>bitmaps</em>, divide the image into a series of discrete
      picture elements, or &ldquo;pixels&rdquo;, and assign each one a
      number that represents its color. Deciding how many pixels to
      use (&ldquo;resolution&rdquo;) determines how small each pixel
      is. Any details that are smaller than the size of one individual
      pixel are lost. A higher resolution saves more detail but
      results in larger file-sizes and thus slower page loading
      times. <strong>When submitting images for publication, higher
      resolutions are generally better</strong>; I can always remove detail but
      I can't add it back in once it's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Vector graphics</em>, on the other hand, describe the image
      as being made up of various shapes, or &ldquo;vectors&rdquo;. A
      clock-face might be described as a black circle with a specific
      thickness; another slightly smaller circle filled with white;
      and various straight black lines of different lengths. The
      advantage here is that all the details of the image are captured
      perfectly. As a result, the image can be scaled to any size with
      no loss of quality. The catch is that the image has to be
      designed and saved as a vector graphic using something
      like <a href="https://www.inkscape.org/" title="Inkscape
      homepage">Inkscape</a> or Adobe Illustrator. A vector graphic
      can be converted into a raster graphic but a raster graphic
      cannot be converted back into a vector graphic. For this
      reason, <strong>please send me vector graphics if
      possible.</strong>

<h2 id="lossless">Photographs vs. Graphics (Lossy vs Lossless)</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>Not all raster graphics are created equal. As discussed earlier,
      storing a higher level of detail requires higher resolutions and so
      results in larger file-sizes. Techniques have been developed that
      compress the image into a smaller file-size; these are known
      as <em>compression algorithms</em>. They can be devided into two
      categories; <em>lossy compression</em> makes permanent changes to the
      image, while <em>lossless</em> algorithms do
      not. The trade-off is that lossy compression can achieve smaller
      file-sizes.
    </p>
    <p id="lossy">
      The JPEG standard divides the image into 8 pixel square sections
      and converts each section to a series of frequency components. A
      full explanation can be found
      on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">wikipedia</a>. This
      process introduces some artifacts into the image and so it is an
      example of <em>lossy compression</em>. In photographs, these
      artifacts are generally not noticeable and the benefits in
      file-size reduction are significant. In flat graphics (logos,
      etc.), these artifacts become noticeable and file-sizes are
      usually not much better than lossless alogirithms, like PNG. A
      lossless image can be converted to JPEG but I cannot go the
      otherway around without a considerable amount of
      work. <strong>Please submit logos and similar graphics using PNG
      or another lossless format</strong>; photographs can be sent as
      JPEG files.
