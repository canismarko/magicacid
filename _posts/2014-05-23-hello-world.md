So I've decided to start a blog. I think I'll make it about
**chemistry**. You know, explaining everyday phenomena in a way that's
both informative and easy to understand. Who knows if I'll
succeed. I'm also planning to throw some stuff in about **going to
grad school** and **computer programming**.

I'll probably need a fair amount of content to post so if you have
**chemistry related questions**, I'd love to hear about them. I've put
up a thread **[here](/chemistry/ask-a-chemist/2014/05/23/ask-a-chemist.html "Ask a chemist thread")**. Leave a comment with your question and I'll see what
I can dig up. I'm thinking of starting out with a post on how oxygen
gets transported from your lungs to your muscles.
