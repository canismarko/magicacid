      What if I told you carbon monoxide detectors are a scam? Well
      I'd be lying. <strong>Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that
      gets into your red blood cells and messes everything
      up</strong>; knowing when it's in your house is worth the
      investment. It doesn't help that it's colorless and odorless
      either. We had some furnace troubles last winter and after a
      night of not being sure if we'd die quietly in our sleep, I
      decided to buy a CO detector ($20 at my local hardware
      store). In order to understand why carbon monoxide is so deadly,
      we first need to learn a little about how the body transports
      oxygen.

      It starts with red blood cells. These are special cells
      that are really rich in a molecule
      called <strong>hemoglobin</strong>. It's a big curled up protein
      with an iron atom in just the right place. This iron atom wants
      electrons and holds on to the extra ones that are in a molecule
      of oxygen. The rest of the protein makes sure there's a space
      that's just big enough to fit an oxygen molecule (more on this
      later). Each molecule of hemoglobin has four of these iron
      centers. When the red blood cells are in a place with lots of
      oxygen, like your lungs, these four sites fill up quickly. When
      the cells are in an area with low oxygen, like your muscles
      during a workout, then hemoglobin rearranges and lets go of the
      oxygen so your muscle can use it to turn carbs into energy.

      An iron atom can bind an oxygen molecule while the rest of the
      protein makes a nice pocket that keeps other things out of the
      way.

  So what about carbon monoxide? Well it's a similar shape and size to
  an oxygen molecule. They have some other properties in common too,
  like sticking to that iron atom. <strong>The problem is that carbon
  monoxide binds to the iron way better than oxygen does.</strong> So
  much so that no matter how much rearrangement it does in your
  muscles, <strong>hemoglobin can't shake any CO molecules that are
  attached</strong>. It gets worse, actually. Once a carbon monoxide
  is stuck to one of the four oxygen-binding sites, it gums up the
  other three so they don't work properly either.

      Humans (and other animals) have evolved some defenses against
      this problem, namely in the structure of hemoglobin
      itself. Remember how I said that the protein has an
      oxygen-shaped pocket next to the iron? One way in which oxygen
      and CO are different is in how they stick to the iron atom;
      carbon monoxide sticks out straight and oxygen at an
      angle. There's a pentagon-shaped part right next to where the
      oxygen sits. It doesn't really bother the bent oxygen much but
      it gets in the way of the straight carbon monoxide. This means
      that the oxygen can fit into that space a lot better than cabon
      monoxide can. Carbon monoxide still binds to hemoglobin about
      250 times better than oxygen does, but it gives your body the
      ability to tolerate a low level of the poisonous gas.

      Oxygen (left image, light-red) binds in a slightly bent
      configuration which doesn't get in the way of the distal
      hystadine (blue-green pentagon). The straight carbon monoxide
      molecule (right image, light-red) doesn't fit nearly as well.

  Levels of naturally occuring carbon monoxide are rarely high enough
  to overwhelm this defense. However, incomplete burning of
  fossil-fuels like the natural gas in our furnace, creates
  artificially high levels in the immediate area and there hasn't been
  nearly enough time for our species to evolve any sort of
  response. The symptoms of cabon monoxide poisoning are pretty
  general (headache, nausea, etc). If you have a CO detector, on the
  other hand, you can do something about it. Get yourself and loved
  ones to some fresh air. In regular air it takes about 2-6 hours for
  half of the carbon monoxide to be replaced with good old oxygen. If
  you're given pure oxygen at 3 atmospheres, this time goes down to
  tens of minutes. And if you don't have a CO detector, go get one
  right now.
