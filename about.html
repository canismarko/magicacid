    <h1>What's the Blog About?</h1>
    <p>Short answer: Mostly chemistry but whatever I feel like at the time</p>
    <p>
      Long answer: I will mostly focus on <strong>chemistry</strong>
      in a very general sense. Before starting grad school I worked
      for a spice extraction company so <strong>food science</strong>
      topics will probably show up from time to time, especially
      concerning the dialog between <strong>natural versus
      artificial</strong> since that came up a lot while I worked
      there. I focused on <strong>antioxidants</strong> which is an
      often abused term so I may write a little about the chemistry
      going on there.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a (not exclusive) list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Energy and chemistry in society</li>
      <li>Everyday things that use chemistry</li>
      <li>Ingredients and food (especially natural vs synthetic)</li>
      <li>Atheism, religion and secularism</li>
      <li>Computer programming, especially open source</li>
      <li>Open science and data exchange</li>
      <li>Interplay between politics and science</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Who are you?</h1>
    <p>
      Just a guy who loves science and geeky things. I'm currently
      working on my PhD in physical chemistry at the University of
      Illinois at Chicago. My research focuses on the characterization
      of electrochemical reactions in lithium-ion batteries.I also
      have a bit of a fascination with <strong>computers</strong> so
      the combination of using computers to do science is particularly
      interesting to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of a professional setting, I enjoy playing soccer,
      snowboarding, music, and dungeons and dragons. I play bass
      although not that well. If I can afford it, I'll gladly go
      anywhere anywhen and hit the mountain. My most zen moments all
      involve fresh powder.

      I'm always up for learning more about things I don't
      understand. If you have an idea for a post, please
      <strong>leave a comment on
